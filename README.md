sppm-student performance prediction model

Problem Statement:

In the educational sector, one of the critical challenges is identifying and supporting students who are at risk of underperforming or dropping out. Traditional methods often fail to provide timely and personalized interventions, resulting in poor academic outcomes and increased dropout rates. The lack of early identification and tailored support contributes to widening educational disparities, affecting students' future opportunities and well-being.


To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a machine learning-based student performance prediction model. The model will analyze academic and non-academic factors to predict student performance, identify at-risk students, and recommend personalized interventions. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project seeks to enhance academic support, improve overall student performance, and increase graduation rates.


Objectives:

Identify At-Risk Students: Predict which students are at risk of underperforming or dropping out.

Improve Academic Outcomes: Provide personalized recommendations and interventions to help students improve their academic performance.

Enhance Resource Allocation: Optimize the allocation of educational resources based on student needs and performance predictions.


Goals:

Increase Graduation Rates: Improve overall graduation rates by providing targeted support to at-risk students.

Boost Academic Performance: Enhance the academic performance of students through early identification and intervention.

Support Educators: Equip teachers and administrators with data-driven insights to tailor their teaching strategies and support mechanisms.


By implementing this solution, the project aims to foster a supportive and effective learning environment, ultimately helping students achieve their full potential and succeed in their academic endeavors.
